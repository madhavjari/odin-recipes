                <li>Desired toppings (e.g., pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives)</li>
                <li>Crushed tomatoes or passata</li>
                <li>Black pepper</li>
                <li>Dried oregano</li>
                <li>Garlic powder</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the Dough (if not using pre-made): If making your own dough, follow your specific recipe instructions for mixing, kneading, and rising. This typically takes a few hours. If using store-bought dough, let it come to room temperature for about 30 minutes before you start.</li>
                <li>Preheat Oven & Pizza Stone/Steel (Optional): Place your pizza stone or steel (if using) in the oven. Preheat your oven to its highest setting (usually 220-250°C / 425-480°F) for at least 30-60 minutes. If not using a stone/steel, just preheat the oven.</li>
                <li>Prepare the Sauce: In a bowl, combine the crushed tomatoes (or passata), olive oil, dried oregano, garlic powder (or fresh minced garlic), salt, and black pepper. Stir well to combine. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
                <li>Prepare Toppings: Slice or prepare all your desired toppings (vegetables, meats, etc.). This ensures everything is ready when you assemble the pizza.</li>
                <li>Shape the Dough: Lightly flour your work surface and your hands. Gently stretch or roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness and shape (round or rectangular). If it springs back, let it rest for 5-10 minutes and try again.</li>
                <li>Transfer Dough to Peel/Baking Sheet: Carefully transfer the shaped dough to a lightly floured or semolina-dusted pizza peel, or directly onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Spread the Sauce: Using the back of a spoon, evenly spread the prepared tomato sauce over the dough, leaving about a 1/2-inch border for the crust.</li>
                <li>Add Cheese: Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
                <li>Add Toppings: Arrange your chosen toppings over the cheese. Don't overload the pizza, as it can make it soggy.</li>
                <li>Bake the Pizza</li>
                <li>Cook Until Golden: Bake for 8-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted, bubbly, and slightly browned in spots. Cooking time will vary based on your oven and desired crispness.</li>
