                <li>Cook the Pasta: Once the water is boiling, add your chosen pasta (see ingredients below). Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Cook according to package directions until al dente (firm to the bite).</li>
                <li>Prepare the Sauce Base (While Pasta Cooks): While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet or pan over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Sauté Aromatics: Add the minced garlic to the hot oil and sauté for about 1 minute until fragrant. Be careful not to burn it.</li>

                <li>Season the Sauce: Add the dried oregano, red pepper flakes (if using), and a good pinch of salt and black pepper to the sauce. Stir to combine.</li>
                <li>Simmer the Sauce: Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer and let it cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld and the sauce to thicken slightly.</li>
                <li>Add Fresh Basil: Once the sauce has simmered, tear or roughly chop the fresh basil leaves and stir them into the sauce. Cook for another minute or two, just until the basil wilts.</li>
                <li>Combine Pasta and Sauce: Before draining the pasta, reserve about 1/2 cup of the starchy pasta water. Drain the cooked pasta. Add the drained pasta directly to the skillet with the sauce.</li>
                <li>Toss and Adjust: Toss the pasta with the sauce until it's well coated. If the sauce seems too thick, add a tablespoon or two of the reserved pasta water at a time until you reach your desired consistency.</li>
